Multiple document kind
  each has a template and input parameters
  output is a PDF

Document kinds:
  CashIn, CashOut, Procurement Document, Inventory Document

string parser
  query(GET): "kind:ID" => eg.: "cash_in:7a", "cash_out:19", "procurement:7b"
  query(POST): "kind:data_object" => eg.: "cash_in:serialized_escaped_json"

message Query {
  string method = 1;
  string kind = 2;
  string query = 3;
  // This is the created_by user
  // but when we have a GET query, we
  // actually do not create anything
  // Thats why we renamed it to query_by_userid
  string query_by_userid = 4;
}

method & kind can be URL param,
  query should be request BODY as JSON object.

Once we have a deserialized QUERY, then we need to serialize it into String,
  and send it a generic query string.
